  # README Generator

  ## Description

    The purpose of this project was to be able to use inquirer to make a README file. In this short project, the point was to be able to explore the abilities of node inquirer, as well as getting used to making new files using the file system in node. I learned how to use inquirer and how to write a file. It was relatively simple, especially following the miniproject that was gone over in week 9 of our bootcamp.

  ## Installation
    In order to be able to use this application properly, you will need to install inquirer and the file system npm package in your command line using node. 
  ## Usage
    To use this application, simply type node index.js, and hit enter. The command line will prompt you with several questions related to creating a README file. Once all answers have been given, it will write the README file for you. ~~BUT BEWARE!~~ if a README file already exists in the root folder, it will override it!
